This repository looks at the data collected by Inside Airbnb in 2021 New York City. This paper will explore and predict the factors that affect the pricing of the Airbnbs in New York.


It is organized as follows:

The Inputs folder:
The listings.csv and listings_details.csv datasets are the original datasets gotten from the data source. The raw_data.csv is the main dataset used in this paper which contains the cleaned and modified data.

The Outputs folder:
The rmd file contains the analysis report on the factors that affect the price of the Airbnb listings, as well as the code used to create the report. The pdf file contains the same analysis report but in pdf form, and without the code. The reference.bib file contains the citations for the raw data, the website that the data is gotten from, packages and literature used in the report.

The Scripts folder:
The data_cleaning.R file contains the code for reading the raw csv format data, cleaning and modifying the variables, and saving the csv file.
